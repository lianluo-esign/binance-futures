## Review Framework: The 7 Rust OOP Principles

### 1. Composition Over Inheritance

**✅ Look For:**
- Struct composition with clear component relationships
- Dependency injection patterns
- Modular, reusable components
- Clear separation of concerns

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Complex trait inheritance chains
- Overly nested trait bounds
- Attempting to simulate class inheritance
- Tight coupling between components

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ❌ Flag this pattern
pub trait Vehicle: Engine + GPS + Audio {
    // Complex inheritance chain
}

// ✅ Suggest this instead
pub struct Car {
    engine: Engine,
    gps: Option<GPS>,
    audio: AudioSystem,
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Is the code using composition to build complex functionality?
- Are components loosely coupled and independently testable?
- Can functionality be easily extended without modifying existing code?

### 2. Trait-Based Polymorphism

**✅ Look For:**
- Well-defined trait interfaces
- Appropriate use of `Box<dyn Trait>` for dynamic dispatch
- Generic constraints `<T: Trait>` for static dispatch
- Default trait implementations to reduce code duplication
- Associated types for cleaner generic interfaces

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Overuse of trait objects when generics would suffice
- Missing trait bounds
- Traits that are too broad or too narrow
- Inconsistent method naming across similar traits

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ✅ Good trait design
pub trait Repository {
    type Item;
    type Error;
    
    fn save(&mut self, item: Self::Item) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    fn find(&self, id: u32) -> Result<Option<Self::Item>, Self::Error>;
    
    // Default implementation
    fn exists(&self, id: u32) -> Result<bool, Self::Error> {
        self.find(id).map(|item| item.is_some())
    }
}

// ❌ Flag: Overly complex trait
pub trait ComplexProcessor: Send + Sync + Clone + Debug + PartialEq {
    // Too many bounds, consider splitting
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Are traits focused on single responsibilities?
- Is the choice between dynamic and static dispatch appropriate?
- Are trait bounds minimal and necessary?

### 3. Module System Encapsulation

**✅ Look For:**
- Logical module organization by functionality
- Proper visibility controls (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`)
- Clean public APIs with hidden implementation details
- Consistent module structure across the codebase

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Everything marked as `pub` without consideration
- Modules that are too large or too granular
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Inconsistent naming conventions

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ✅ Good encapsulation
pub mod market {
    pub use self::orderbook::OrderBook;
    pub use self::types::{Price, Volume};
    
    mod orderbook; // Private implementation
    mod types;     // Public types only
}

// ❌ Flag: Poor encapsulation
pub struct InternalDetail {
    pub internal_state: HashMap<String, String>, // Should be private
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Is the module structure intuitive and logical?
- Are implementation details properly hidden?
- Is the public API minimal and well-designed?

### 4. Type System Compile-Time Checks

**✅ Look For:**
- Newtype patterns for domain-specific types
- Effective use of enums for state representation
- Type state patterns for encoding business rules
- Generic constraints that prevent invalid usage

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Primitive obsession (using `String` instead of domain types)
- Missing type constraints
- Runtime checks that could be compile-time
- Overly permissive function signatures

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ✅ Good type safety
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Price(f64);

impl Price {
    pub fn new(value: f64) -> Result<Self, PriceError> {
        if value >= 0.0 {
            Ok(Price(value))
        } else {
            Err(PriceError::Negative)
        }
    }
}

// ❌ Flag: Primitive obsession
fn calculate_fee(price: f64, volume: f64) -> f64 {
    // Should use Price and Volume types
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Are domain concepts represented by specific types?
- Can invalid states be represented at the type level?
- Are compile-time guarantees maximized?

### 5. Ownership System Memory Safety

**✅ Look For:**
- Clear ownership semantics
- Appropriate use of references vs owned values
- RAII patterns for resource management
- Smart pointers used correctly (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Box`)

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Unnecessary cloning
- Dangling references or lifetime issues
- Resource leaks
- Fighting the borrow checker instead of designing with it

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ✅ Good ownership design
impl ResourceManager {
    pub fn add_resource(&mut self, resource: Resource) {
        self.resources.push(resource); // Takes ownership
    }
    
    pub fn get_resource(&self, id: usize) -> Option<&Resource> {
        self.resources.get(id) // Returns reference
    }
}

// ❌ Flag: Unnecessary cloning
fn process_data(data: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
    data.iter().map(|s| s.clone()).collect() // Unnecessary clone
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Is ownership transferred only when necessary?
- Are lifetimes properly managed?
- Is memory usage efficient?

### 6. Zero-Cost Abstractions with Generics

**✅ Look For:**
- Generics preferred over trait objects for performance
- Associated types for cleaner generic interfaces
- Well-structured `where` clauses
- Monomorphization-friendly code

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Overuse of dynamic dispatch
- Complex generic constraints that hurt readability
- Missing bounds that could catch errors
- Generic parameters that should be associated types

**Example Review Comments:**
```rust
// ✅ Good generic design
fn process_items<R, I>(repo: &mut R, items: Vec<I>) -> Result<(), R::Error>
where
    R: Repository<Item = I>,
    I: Clone + Debug,
{
    // Zero-cost abstraction
}

// ❌ Flag: Runtime dispatch when compile-time would work
fn render_shapes(shapes: &[Box<dyn Drawable>]) {
    // Could this be generic instead?
}
```

**Review Questions:**
- Can dynamic dispatch be replaced with generics?
- Are generic constraints minimal but sufficient?
- Will this code compile to efficient machine code?

### 7. File Size and Organization

**✅ Look For:**
- Files under 1000 lines
- Logical code organization
- Proper use of `mod.rs` for module organization
- Related functionality grouped together

**❌ Flag These Issues:**
- Files exceeding 1000 lines
- Unrelated functionality in the same file
- Poor module structure
- Missing re-exports in module files

**Review Questions:**
- Is the file size manageable?
- Is the code logically organized?
- Can large files be split into smaller, focused modules?

### Comment Structure Template

```
**Issue Type**: [Architecture/Performance/Safety/Style]
**Severity**: [Critical/Important/Suggestion]

**Problem**: 
[Describe what you found]

**Why This Matters**: 
[Explain the impact or reasoning]

**Suggested Solution**:
```rust
// Suggested improvement
```

**Alternative Approaches**:
[If applicable, mention other options]
```

### Example Review Comments

#### Critical Issue
```
**Issue Type**: Memory Safety
**Severity**: Critical

**Problem**: 
Line 45: This code creates a dangling reference that could cause undefined behavior.

**Why This Matters**: 
The reference `item_ref` outlives the scope of `temp_vec`, leading to a use-after-free scenario.

**Suggested Solution**:
```rust
// Instead of returning a reference to temporary data
fn get_item(&self, id: usize) -> Option<&Item> {
    self.items.get(id)  // Return reference to owned data
}
```
```

#### Performance Suggestion
```
**Issue Type**: Performance
**Severity**: Suggestion

**Problem**: 
Line 23: Unnecessary cloning of strings in the loop.

**Why This Matters**: 
This creates N heap allocations where references would suffice, impacting performance.

**Suggested Solution**:
```rust
// Use references instead of cloning
for item in &items {  // Borrow instead of move
    process_item(item);  // Pass reference
}
```
```

#### Architecture Improvement
```
**Issue Type**: Architecture
**Severity**: Important

**Problem**: 
The `DataProcessor` struct has too many responsibilities (parsing, validation, storage).

**Why This Matters**: 
Violates single responsibility principle and makes testing and maintenance difficult.

**Suggested Solution**:
```rust
// Split into focused components
pub struct DataProcessor {
    parser: Parser,
    validator: Validator,
    storage: Storage,
}
```
```

## Common Rust Idioms to Encourage

### Builder Pattern
```rust
pub struct ConfigBuilder {
    host: Option<String>,
    port: Option<u16>,
    timeout: Option<Duration>,
}

impl ConfigBuilder {
    pub fn host(mut self, host: impl Into<String>) -> Self {
        self.host = Some(host.into());
        self
    }
    
    pub fn build(self) -> Result<Config, ConfigError> {
        // Validation and construction
    }
}
```

### Iterator Patterns
```rust
// Encourage functional style
let results: Vec<_> = data
    .iter()
    .filter(|item| item.is_valid())
    .map(|item| item.process())
    .collect();
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```rust
// Custom error types with context
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ProcessingError {
    #[error("Invalid input data: {message}")]
    InvalidInput { message: String },
    
    #[error("Network error: {source}")]
    Network { #[from] source: reqwest::Error },
}
```

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

### String Abuse
```rust
// ❌ Avoid
fn process(data: String) -> String {
    // Forces allocation even for read-only operations
}

// ✅ Prefer
fn process(data: &str) -> String {
    // Accepts both &str and &String without allocation
}
```

### Excessive Cloning
```rust
// ❌ Avoid
fn expensive_operation(items: Vec<LargeStruct>) -> Vec<LargeStruct> {
    items.into_iter().map(|item| item.clone()).collect()
}

// ✅ Prefer
fn expensive_operation(items: &mut [LargeStruct]) {
    for item in items {
        item.modify_in_place();
    }
}
```

### Poor Error Handling
```rust
// ❌ Avoid
fn might_fail() -> Option<Data> {
    // Lost error information
}

// ✅ Prefer
fn might_fail() -> Result<Data, ProcessingError> {
    // Preserves error context
}
```

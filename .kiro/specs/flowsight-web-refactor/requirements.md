# Requirements Document

## Introduction

FlowSight Web Refactor is a complete architectural transformation project that converts the existing Rust-based desktop trading analysis application into a modern, web-based platform using Next.js 14. This refactor aims to maintain all existing professional trading analysis capabilities while providing enhanced accessibility, modern user experience, and simplified deployment through web technologies.

The new web application will feature a three-panel layout optimized for professional trading analysis: left-side order book, upper-right real-time active order chart, and lower-right footprint chart displaying 5-minute candlestick price level accumulation.

## Requirements

2. WHEN bid orders are shown THEN the system SHALL color them green with appropriate volume bars
3. WHEN ask orders are shown THEN the system SHALL color them red with appropriate volume bars
4. WHEN active trades occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding price levels temporarily
5. IF order book has more than 40 levels THEN the system SHALL implement virtualized scrolling for performance

### Requirement 5: Active Order Chart

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see a real-time line chart with dynamic dots representing active trades, so that I can visualize trade flow and volume intensity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN active buy trades occur THEN the system SHALL plot green dots with size proportional to volume
2. WHEN active sell trades occur THEN the system SHALL plot red dots with size proportional to volume
3. WHEN price changes THEN the system SHALL draw continuous lines connecting trade points
4. WHEN displaying recent data THEN the system SHALL show the last 5 minutes of trading activity
5. IF no trades occur for 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL maintain the last known price line

### Requirement 6: Footprint Chart Implementation

**User Story:** As a professional trader, I want to see footprint charts showing price level volume accumulation within 5-minute candlesticks, so that I can analyze order flow at specific price levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating footprint data THEN the system SHALL aggregate trades into 5-minute candlestick intervals
2. WHEN displaying price levels THEN the system SHALL show buy volume (green) and sell volume (red) for each price within the candlestick
3. WHEN volume data is available THEN the system SHALL use color intensity to represent volume density
4. WHEN candlestick is complete THEN the system SHALL display OHLC framework with embedded volume levels
5. IF price level has no volume THEN the system SHALL optionally hide empty levels based on configuration

### Requirement 7: State Management and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain responsive performance with efficient memory usage, so that I can run it continuously without degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing market data THEN the system SHALL use Zustand for client-side state management
2. WHEN managing real-time data THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache with automatic cleanup of old data
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds 200MB THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and data pruning
4. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps rendering performance
5. IF event queue grows beyond 1000 items THEN the system SHALL implement event batching

### Requirement 8: WebSocket Connection Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want reliable WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection, so that I never miss critical market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing connection THEN the system SHALL connect to Binance WebSocket streams for depth, trade, and ticker data
2. WHEN connection drops THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
3. WHEN reconnection succeeds THEN the system SHALL resume data processing without data loss
